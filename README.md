Robot QuickStart Guide Code in One place
========================================

This is an exact refactored copy of Robot QuickStart Guide 
(https://github.com/robotframework/QuickStartGuide). I found it is more
helpful to have all test codes in programmer friendly manner than
in a .rst file. 

How To Execute:
---------------
Go to the downlded (after clone from git) directory and run
       > robot  .

This executes all tests under the current directory. This assumes robot
framework is already installed.
